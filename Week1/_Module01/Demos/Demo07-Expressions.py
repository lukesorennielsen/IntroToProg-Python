# Numeric Expression:
x = 5 + 3 * 2

# In this example, the expression 5 + 3 * 2 is evaluated to give the value 11,
# which is then assigned to the variable x.

# String Concatenation Expression:
greeting = "Hello, " + "world!"

# Here, the expression "Hello, " + "world!" concatenates the two string values to
# produce the string "Hello, world!", which is assigned to the variable greeting.

# Function Call Expression:
result = max(7, 9)

# In this expression, the max() function is called with the arguments 7 and 9.
# The function evaluates the expression and returns the maximum value,
# which is then assigned to the variable result.
